Welcome to my new website. This is now the third location for it after wordpress and weebly. I intend to stick with this one now as it has been built from scratch. This [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) was essential to getting it up and running (thanks very much!). I'm hosting this on [GitHub](https://github.com), and using [Jeckyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and a bit of [Pure.css](http://purecss.io/) to help with page alignment.  

I'm hoping to keep this blog up to date with regular updates of my research, including some interesting [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) code, as well as other things I find interesting along the way. 

All the best,   
Jono
