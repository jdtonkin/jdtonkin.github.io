I'm very excited to announce that I have recently joined the Editorial Board of [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/). I'm really looking forward to handling my first manuscript. 

This is a relatively new open access journal with a really interesting [pricing plan](https://peerj.com/pricing/) for open access publications. Basically it's a one-off payment of US$100 for your first publication, which allows you to publish one paper per year after that for free. For a total of US$300 you get to publish an unlimited number of papers open access for the rest of your life.

My process as an author there has been super smooth, so I highly recommend PeerJ and certainly plan to continue publishing there. They also host preprints for free [here](https://peerj.com/preprints/). I currently have a few hosted there, which you can see on my [profile page](https://peerj.com/jdtonkin/).
